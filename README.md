- **Satisfaction** :
In this project, we aim to build a model using data related to passenger satisfaction with the services provided by airlines, which can predict the final opinion of passengers, i.e., satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

- **Artist** :
We aim to train a deep learning model that, like an art expert, can correctly guess the artist of a painting whose creator is not yet known by simply viewing it.
